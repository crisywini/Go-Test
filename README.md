This project is created only to test the Go Programming Language
## The Go Programming Language

Basically this programming language is really interesting because its learning rate is really low, I just learned the most of the things in 5 days since I
started to study. This Repository has the beginning of my knowledge in this awesome programming language. I started to study based on the book:
"The Way To Go A Thorough Introduction To The Go Programming Language" for my Compiler Class.
